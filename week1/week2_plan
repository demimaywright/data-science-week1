WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Demi Wright]
Date: [5/2/26]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [NA values are present]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Missing Data]

Which variable(s) affected: [Eggs laid, hatched and body mass (mg)]

Why this is important to fix: [may skew visualisation and analysis if left uchecked]

What I plan to do: [use the drop.na command to omit values]



ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [duplicates]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [duplicates]

Which variable(s) affected: [13 data entries]

Why this is important to fix: [Skews data if not genuine repeats]

What I plan to do: [flag for review, continue analysis by removing duplicates]



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - Site A, B, C incontinuity]
- [Issue 4 - ]

QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
